**CyberDefender** is an interactive cybersecurity incident simulator designed to help users improve their incident response skills by tackling real-world scenarios. The game presents a series of cybersecurity challenges where users must analyze logs, identify suspicious activity, and make decisions on how to respond. It's built with Python and uses Tkinter for the user interface, along with animations for an engaging experience.

 **Features**
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Tackle a variety of cybersecurity incidents like suspicious logins, malware detection, and phishing attacks.
- **Interactive Log Analysis**: Analyze system logs to identify anomalies and make the right call in each scenario.
- **Automated Feedback**: Receive instant feedback on your decisions, with detailed explanations on why your choice was correct or incorrect.
- **Customizable Scenarios**: Add new cybersecurity scenarios and tailor responses for dynamic learning.
- **Animations**: Incorporate animations to visually engage users (e.g., hacker image spinning and flashing after game completion).
- **End Game Summary**: At the end of the game, view your performance, including the number of correct/incorrect decisions, and receive tips based on your mistakes.

 **Technologies Used**
- Python
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- Pygame (for animations and graphical effects)
- Various animation frameworks (for visual effects)
